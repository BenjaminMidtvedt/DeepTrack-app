'''Base class Feature and structural features

Provides classes and tools for creating and interacting with features.

Classes
-------
Feature
    Base abstract class.
StructuralFeature
    Abstract extension of feature for interactions between features.
Branch
    Implementation of `StructuralFeature` that resolves two features 
    sequentially.
Probability
    Implementation of `StructuralFeature` that randomly resolves a feature 
    with a certain probability.
Duplicate
    Implementation of `StructuralFeature` that sequentially resolves an 
    integer number of deep-copies of a feature.

class Feature(ABC):
    ''' Base feature class.
    Features define the image generation process. All features operate
    on lists of images. Most features, such as noise, apply some
    tranformation to all images in the list. This transformation can
    be additive, such as adding some Gaussian noise or a background
    illumination, or non-additive, such as introducing Poisson noise
    or performing a low-pass filter. This transformation is defined
    by the method `get(image, **kwargs)`, which all implementations of
    the class `Feature` need to define.

    Whenever a Feature is initiated, all keyword arguments passed to the
    constructor will be wrapped as a Property, and stored in the
    `properties` field as a `PropertyDict`. When a Feature is resolved,
    the current value of each property is sent as input to the get method.

    Parameters
    ----------
    *args : dict, optional
        Dicts passed as nonkeyword arguments will be deconstructed to key-value 
        pairs and included in the field `properties` in the same way as keyword 
        arguments.
    **kwargs
        All Keyword arguments will be wrapped as instances of ``Property`` and 
        included in the field `properties`.


    Attributes
    ----------
    properties : dict
        A dict that contains all keyword arguments passed to the
        constructor wrapped as Distributions. A sampled copy of this
        dict is sent as input to the get function, and is appended
        to the properties field of the output image.
    __list_merge_strategy__ : int
        Controls how the output of `.get(image, **kwargs)` is merged with 
        the input list. It can be `MERGE_STRATEGY_OVERRIDE` (0, default),
        where the input is replaced by the new list, or
        `MERGE_STRATEGY_APPEND` (1), where the new list is appended to the
        end of the input list.
    __distributed__ : bool
        Controls whether `.get(image, **kwargs)` is called on each element
        in the list separately (`__distributed__ = True`), or if it is
        called on the list as a whole (`__distributed__ = False`).
    __property_memorability__
        Controls whether to store the features properties to the `Image`. 
        Values 1 or lower will be included by default.
